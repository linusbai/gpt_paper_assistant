1. Deep clustering using autoencoders
   - Relevant: Papers discussing the application of autoencoders in deep clustering.
   - Not relevant: Papers that focus on other clustering methods without using autoencoders.

2. Graph neural networks for deep clustering
   - Relevant: Papers that explore the use of graph neural networks (GNN) in deep clustering.
   - Not relevant: Papers unrelated to deep clustering or that do not involve GNN.

3. Transformer-based deep clustering
   - Relevant: Papers discussing the application of Transformers in deep clustering scenarios.
   - Not relevant: Papers that focus on Transformers but not in the context of deep clustering.

4. GANs in deep clustering and improved networks
   - Relevant: Papers combining GANs with deep clustering techniques or proposing improved networks.
   - Not relevant: Papers solely focusing on GANs without a deep clustering context.

5. Hybrid models incorporating autoencoders, GNN, Transformer for deep clustering
   - Relevant: Papers proposing hybrid models that combine autoencoders, GNN, and/or Transformers for deep clustering.
   - Not relevant: Papers that do not involve a combination of these techniques in the context of deep clustering.
